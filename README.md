Archon
===========

Private server implementation for Sega's Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst. 
Credit is owed to the authors of [Tethealla](http://pioneer2.net), 
[Newserv](http://www.fuzziqersoftware.com), and [Sylverant](http://sylverant.net), 
whose servers I'm studying as I write Archon.

The goal of this project is to build a configurable, high-performing, and scalable
PSOBB server that can be run across multiple platforms with little setup overhead. 
The project is currently in its early stages and changing rapidly while I piece 
together the PSO protocol and develop a core archiecture.

Forks, bug fixes, issue reports, etc. are welcome!
